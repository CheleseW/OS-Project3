## size FILENAME

## ls DIRNAME

## read FILENAME OFFSET SIZE

If the file has been opened in read mode, it prints out SIZE bytes starting at OFFSET.

## write FILENAME OFFSET SIZE "STRING"

If the file has been opened in write mode, it writes SIZE bytes of "STRING" starting at OFFSET.

If OFFSET + SIZE is greater than the current filesize, it will increase the file size for that file's entry.

If SIZE is greater than the length of "STRING", all additional bytes will be 0.

## rm FILENAME

Removes the file called FILENAME and marks all associated FAT entries as empty.

Also removes the long name entry if applicable.

# Things to Note

All commands will only search the current directory for files and subdirectories. The "." and ".." subdirectories point to their respective locations and are valid arguments for destinations. Absolute paths are not valid arguments.

All file and directory names are converted to uppercase as per the FAT32 specifications, including the user input before being compared to the entry names. Names can be no longer than 8 characters.
